    "Data cleaning is a key part of data science, but it can be deeply frustrating. Why are some of your text fields garbled? What should you do about those missing values? Why aren’t your dates formatted correctly? How can you quickly clean up inconsistent data entry? In this course, you'll learn why you've run into these problems and, more importantly, how to fix them!\n",
